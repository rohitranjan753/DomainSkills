# ALGORITHMS

## What is an Algorithm
1. An algorithm is a process or a set of rules required to perform calculations or some
other problem solving operations especially by a computer.

2. The formal definition of an algorithm is that it contains the finite set of instructions
which are being carried in a specific order to perform the specific task.

3. It is not the complete program or code; it is just a solution (logic) of a problem, which
can be represented either as an informal description using a Flowchart or
Pseudocode.

## ABOUT “ALGORITHM”
1. An algorithm can be defined as a finite set of steps, which has to be followed while carrying out a
particular problem.

2. It is nothing but a process of executing actions step by step.

3. An algorithm is a distinct computational procedure that takes input as a set of values and results
in the output as a set of values by solving the problem.

4. More precisely, an algorithm is correct, if, for each input instance, it gets the correct output and
gets terminated.

5. An algorithm unravels the computational problems to output the desired result.

6. An algorithm can be described by incorporating a natural language such as English, Computer
language, or a hardware language.

## Characteristics of an Algorithm
The following are the characteristics of an algorithm:

1. Input: An algorithm has some input values. We can pass 0 or some input value to an
algorithm.

2. Output: We will get 1 or more output at the end of an algorithm.

3. Unambiguity: An algorithm should be unambiguous which means that the
instructions in an algorithm should be clear and simple.

4. Finiteness: An algorithm should have finiteness. Here, finiteness means that the
algorithm should contain a limited number of instructions, i.e., the instructions
should be countable.

5. Effectiveness: An algorithm should be effective as each instruction in an algorithm
affects the overall process.

6. Language independent: An algorithm must be language independent so that the
instructions in an algorithm can be implemented in any of the languages with the
same output.

7. Definiteness Each instruction should be clear and ambiguous

8. Feasible: It must be feasible enough to produce each instruction.

9. Flexibility: It must be flexible enough to carry out desired changes with no efforts.

10. Efficient: The term efficiency is measured in terms of time and space required by an
algorithm to implement. Thus, an algorithm must ensure that it takes little time and
less memory space meeting the acceptable limit of development time
